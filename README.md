This Python project helps analyze the academic performance of students. It allows you to:

- Input names and marks of multiple students
- Calculate average marks
- Assign grades based on average
- Identify the class topper


# ðŸš€ How It Works

1. The program first asks how many students' data you want to enter.
2. For each student, it takes:
   - Student's name
   - Their marks (space-separated)
3. It calculates:
   - Average marks
   - Grade (A, B, C, D, F)
4. Finally, it prints:
   - All studentsâ€™ averages and grades
   - Name of the class topper


# ðŸ“¥ Sample Input

Enter number of students: 3
Enter student name: Ravi
Enter marks separated by space: 87 91 84
Enter student name: Sita
Enter marks separated by space: 75 82 78
Enter student name: Amit
Enter marks separated by space: 49 60 55


#ðŸ“¥ Sample output
--- Students Report ---
Ravi: Average = 87.33, Grade = B
Sita: Average = 78.33, Grade = C
Amit: Average = 54.67, Grade = F

Topper: Ravi with average 87.33

ðŸ§  Grading Logic

Average (%)	Grade

90+                    	A
80â€“89               	B
70â€“79	               C   	
60â€“69                   D
Below 60          	F
